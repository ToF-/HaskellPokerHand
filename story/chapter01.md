BOB: So how are we going to solve this problem?
TOF: Well I see three questions that will require a bit of thinking..
BOB: What are those questions?
TOF: One is obviously: how do we compare well formed, 5 cards poker hands?
BOB: Yes, we have the rules for that. 
TOF: The second question is: how do we form different hands from each entry line so that we can extract the best possible hand for that player?
BOB: For lines with less than seven cards, that is not necessary. I guess we'll have to find subsequences or something like that. 
TOF: Yes.. The third question is the simplest: how do we display correctly the entry lines along with the scores?
BOB: Wow, solving all those problems is a lot of work. And the customer wants to see a running program very soon!
TOF: Well in that case, what if we showed him a program that works only for High cards for the first version?
BOB: Hey, solving simpler versions of the problem first, I like that! We still have the subsequencing problem, though..
TOF: Well if we recognize only High Cards hands, we just have to sort the cards and take the first five cards on each line. 
BOB: Right!
TOF: Let's go then!
