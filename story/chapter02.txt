That was fast. 

Now we can solve the different problems of finding the best hand. 
What is slightly better than a High Card is a Flush. You have a Flush when all the cards in your hand have the same suit.
To find a Suit in a group of 7 cards, selecting the 5 higher cards is no longer a strategy.
We have to first a) select all subsequences of lenght 5 from that group, and b) rank all those subsequence according to the High Card or Flush rules.

filter ((==5).length) subsequences

will do the trick a)

and b) will be done with

flush (c:cs) = all (\x -> suit x == suit c) cs 

if the group is not a Flush, then it's a High Card

we still have to sort the cards in order to get the best Flush ranking
